* Re-implement the FD read and FD UDP read methods to use EV_PERSIST
  correctly:
  + have an fde_comm flag to say "yes, i've added the event"
  + have an fde_comm flag to say "yes, I've seen an FD_READ event
    but I've not done any IO yet"
  + when someone registers for a comm udp read or comm_read, check
    if the fde_comm flag above indiciates that an FD_READ event
    has been seen, and if so, schedule the ready callback to try
    doing IO
  + And once recvfrom() or read() is done, clear that flag.
  + .. and on error, just delete the event and clear the flags
    above.

  The aim here is to make the FD read code only need to register
  a read FD event once and keep it persistent for the lifespan
  of the commfd state - regardless of whether there's an active
  IO callback going on.

* .. same with comm FD / comm UDP FD write
